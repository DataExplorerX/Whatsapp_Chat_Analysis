# Whatsapp_Chat_Analysis
The project aims to develop a Python program for analyzing and extracting insights from WhatsApp chat data.WhatsApp is a widely used messaging platform with extensive user interactions, making it an interesting source of data for analysis. The program will provide various features to analyze chat history, including message frequency, popular words, active participants, and more.

## To import WhatsApp chat data into your Python program, you need to obtain the chat history as a text file. WhatsApp allows you to export chat logs directly from the app. Here are the steps to follow:

* Open the WhatsApp chat you want to analyze.
* Tap on the three-dot menu icon at the top right corner of the screen.
* Select "More" or "Export Chat" from the menu options.
* Choose whether you want to include media files (images, videos, etc.) or export the chat without media.
* Select the destination for the exported chat file, such as email, cloud storage, or other apps.
* Send the chat export to yourself or save it to a location accessible on your computer.


### Use the above imported Whatsapp group chat to analyse and extract insights from the group chat.
